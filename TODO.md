## In Progress / Remaining

### High Priority

- [ ] **Username selection in onboarding/settings** - Users can't pick their own username yet
- [ ] **Profile card unification** - Consolidate `unified-profile-card.tsx` and `listing-card.tsx` into single component with variants. Currently have duplicated `SlimProfile` types.
- [ ] **Map view for browse** - Show hosts on map with privacy circles

### Medium Priority

- [ ] **References system** - Leave/receive references after meetups
- [ ] **Profile completion indicator** - "You're 80% done!" in onboarding
- [ ] **Last active / response rate** - Show when user was last online
- [ ] **Community Guidelines page** (`/guidelines`)
- [ ] **FAQ page** (`/faq`)

### Low Priority / Post-MVP

- [ ] Phone verification (Clerk supports this)
- [ ] Compatibility score
- [ ] Save/favorite profiles
- [ ] PWA support

- --

## Tech Debt

### Completed

- [x] Fix TypeScript `lastMessage` null vs undefined type mismatch
- [x] Fix city type assertion in profiles.ts
- [x] Remove unused `getConnectionStatusBetween` function (dead code after N+1 fix)
- [x] Remove unused `QueryCtx` import
- [x] Extract shared `usePhotoUpload` hook (reduces PhotoUpload/PhotoGallery complexity)

### Remaining (Complexity Warnings)

Current lint complexity limit is 15. These are flagged but work fine:

| File | Score | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| `OnboardingPage` | 24/15 | 7-step wizard with 15+ fields. Hook created but not integrated yet |
| `usePhotoUpload` | 21/15 | Centralized upload logic - complexity trade-off for reusability |
| `profiles.ts` handler | 17/15 | Complex server query - legitimately complex |
| `profiles.ts` filter | 17/15 | Many filter conditions - idiomatic |
| `login-form` | 16/15 | Clean code, barely over |

* *Decision**: Consider raising biome complexity limit to 20 (would pass login-form & profiles.ts, still flag OnboardingPage and usePhotoUpload for future refactoring).

### Future Considerations

- [ ] Consider Cloudflare R2 for images if scaling past bandwidth limits
- [ ] Integrate `useOnboardingForm` hook (requires updating Step0-Step6 components)
