## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (recommended) or Node.js 20+
- A [Convex](https://convex.dev) account
- A [Clerk](https://clerk.com) account

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies

bun install

# Run development server (starts both Next.js and Convex)

bun dev

```text

Open [[localhost](http://localhost:3000)](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with the following:

```env
# Convex

CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=dev:your-deployment-name
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=[your-deployment.convex.cloud](https://your-deployment.convex.cloud)

# Clerk

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
CLERK_ISSUER_DOMAIN=[your-clerk-issuer-domain](https://your-clerk-issuer-domain)

# Maileroo (for emails)

MAILEROO_API_KEY=...

```text

Also set these in your **Convex Dashboard** (Settings → Environment Variables):

```env
  CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...   # From Clerk webhook endpoint
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...     # Same as above
  CLERK_ISSUER_DOMAIN=[your-clerk-issuer-domain](https://your-clerk-issuer-domain)
  MAILEROO_API_KEY=...             # Transactional email provider

# Optional admin allowlist for dev/admin Convex functions

ADMIN_CLERK_USER_IDS=user_...,user_...

```text

### Clerk Webhook Setup

To enable bi-directional sync between Clerk and Convex:

1. Go to **Clerk Dashboard**→**Webhooks**→**+ Add Endpoint**
2. Set **Endpoint URL**: `[your-deployment.convex.site/clerk-users-webhook%60](https://YOUR-DEPLOYMENT.convex.site/clerk-users-webhook`)
3. Select events: `user.created`, `user.updated`, `user.deleted`
4. Copy the **Signing Secret** and set it as `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Convex

### Migrating / relinking users after changing Clerk issuer or instance

If you previously had users created under a different Clerk issuer (for example, switching from a dev instance to a production instance, or moving to a custom Clerk domain), existing Convex user records may no longer match the Clerk `sub` (user id) that users receive on sign-in.

This repo includes an admin-only Convex action to **relink Convex users to Clerk by email**, preserving the existing Convex user `_id` (so profiles/messages remain intact):

- Convex action: `migrations.relinkUsersByEmailToClerk`
- Env requirements (Convex): `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, `CLERK_ISSUER_DOMAIN`, `ADMIN_CLERK_USER_IDS`

Run it from the Convex dashboard “Functions” panel (as an admin) with a small page size first:

```json
{
  "paginationOpts": { "numItems": 25, "cursor": null },
  "createMissing": false,
  "dryRun": true
}

```text

Then re-run with `"dryRun": false`. If your Clerk instance does not already contain those users, you can set `"createMissing": true` to create missing users in Clerk using their email address.

## Privacy / Compliance (operational notes)

This section is **not legal advice**. It documents how this repo behaves today and what you should keep consistent when operating in production.

### Processors / Subprocessors (what we use)

- **Vercel (hosting)**: serves the Next.js app and may process technical request metadata/logs for reliability and security.
- **Convex (database + server functions)**: stores app data (profiles, messages, invitations, consent records).
- **Clerk (authentication)**: stores account identity/authentication details (e.g., email, auth events) and issues session tokens/cookies.
- **Maileroo (transactional email)**: receives email address + email content needed to send service emails.
- **Sentry (error monitoring)**: receives technical diagnostics about crashes/errors. Client replay is enabled only after analytics consent.
- **Vercel Analytics + Speed Insights (analytics/performance)**: mounted only after analytics consent via [`AnalyticsGate`](components/analytics-gate.tsx:12).

If you add a new third-party service that can access personal data, update the legal pages:
- [`PrivacyPage`](app/(legal)/privacy/page.tsx:369)
- [`CookiesPage`](app/(legal)/cookies/page.tsx:197)

### Consent records (audit trail)

This repo **already records user consent** in Convex via [`api.consents.recordConsent`](convex/consents.ts:23) / [`api.consents.recordMultipleConsents`](convex/consents.ts:64).

When you materially change Terms/Privacy/Cookies:
- Update the policy version in [`CURRENT_POLICY_VERSION`](convex/consents.ts:6)
- Consider requiring users to re-accept on next login/onboarding

### Data retention (recommended operational behavior)

The legal pages describe retention as best-practice ranges. Operationally, keep to these defaults:
- **Account/profile data**: retained while account active; delete/anonymize within ~30 days after deletion request.
- **Messages/invitations**: retain while account active; remove within ~30–90 days after deletion.
- **Consent records**: keep as long as needed to demonstrate compliance (audit trail).
- **Logs/error events**: keep short (typically 30–90 days), unless needed for incident investigation.

If you change retention behavior, update the legal pages and this section.
