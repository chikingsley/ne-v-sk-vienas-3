## Tech Debt

- [x] Remove `@tensorflow/tfjs` from package.json (face-api bundles it internally) - DONE
- [x] Clean up old Bun server files (src/ folder) - DONE (folder doesn't exist)
- [x] Consolidate experiments into `app/(experiments)/` - landing1-3, client1-3, sentry-example-page, location-picker
- [x] Add `@vercel/analytics` to layout.tsx (was missing the `<Analytics />` component)
- [x] Set up Convex testing with vitest (`bun run test`) - 3 tests passing
- [ ] Reduce component complexity (BrowsePage, MessagesPage, ProfilePages) - partially done, still has warnings
- [ ] **[Future] Migrate images to Cloudflare R2** - Zero egress fees vs Convex bandwidth limits (50GB/mo on Pro). Not urgent now, consider if scaling past 1K active users.

## Quick Reference

### Toast Notifications

Yes, we have toasts via Sonner. Used for actions (invite sent, profile saved, errors).
NOT used for real-time message notifications (those use bell icon badge).

```tsx
import { toast } from "sonner";
toast.success("Profile saved!");
toast.error("Something went wrong");
```

### Clerk Phone Verification

Clerk supports phone verification out of the box via SMS. Can be enabled in Clerk dashboard.
Also supports authenticator app (TOTP) for 2FA if needed.
