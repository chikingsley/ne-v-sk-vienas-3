- Languages
- Date

### Matching Flow

```text
1. User browses listings (hosts see guests, guests see hosts)

2. Either side can initiate:
    - Host clicks "Invite" on a guest
    - Guest clicks "Become a guest" on a host

3. Other party gets email notification

4. They accept or decline:
    - Accept → Both get contact details, moved to "Christmas matches" page
    - Decline → Requester gets polite "no" email

5. Celebrate together 🎄

## Legal/Safety Notes

All comparable apps (TimeLeft, 222, Couchsurfing) use the same legal approach:

* *Terms of Service must include:**

- Statement that you are a "platform" not a party to interactions
- Full liability release - users release the company from claims
- User warranties: 18+, no violent/sexual crime history, agreement not to misuse
- GDPR compliance statement (required in EU/Lithuania)
- Right to terminate accounts, reporting mechanism

* *For Lithuania specifically:**

- GDPR compliance required from day one
- Consider whether VšĮ (nonprofit entity) registration is needed, or if informal operation is okay for MVP

* *Key difference from TimeLeft/222**: Those apps use public venues as a safety layer. Private home hosting shifts more risk to users — Terms of Service language matters more.

## Comparable Apps

* *Most similar model (home hosting, mutual matching):**

| App | Model | Key Difference |
|-----|-------|----------------|
| **Couchsurfing** | Browse hosts, send request, mutual accept | For travelers, not holidays |
| **Couchers.org** | Same as CS, free/nonprofit | Direct CS replacement |
| **BeWelcome** | Same as CS, free/nonprofit | Smaller, open source |

* *Nešvęsk vienas is unique**: Combines home hosting with seasonal/holiday focus + support for Ukrainian refugees. Nobody else is doing exactly this.
